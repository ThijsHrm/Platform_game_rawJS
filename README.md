This is a browser-based fangame based on the shareware version of the old platform game "Jazz Jackrabbit". This project was started in order to practice my OOP and general javascript skills. It's not about using the best tools to create the best possible application. It's about learning and improving by having fun :) No libraries were used, everything is written in vanilla javascript and HTML5 canvas. I will try to update it regularly. Feedback is very welcome!
